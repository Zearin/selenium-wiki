# Remote WebDriver

This is information about using the client implementation of the `RemoteWebDriver`. This is the code that is used within your tests. For information on how to set up the server-side, please take a look at the `RemoteWebDriverServer` page.

## Installing

Download the `selenium-server.zip` and unpack. Put the JARs on the <var>CLASSPATH</var>. This will give you the remote webdriver client, which is generally what you need. Please consult the `RemoteWebDriverServer` for information on how to set up the server-side of the remote webdriver.

## Pros

  * Separates where the tests are running from where the browser is.
  * Allows tests to be run with browsers not available on the current OS (because the browser can be elsewhere)

## Cons

  * Requires an external servlet container to be running
  * You may find problems with line endings when getting text from the remote server
  * Introduces extra latency to tests, particularly when exceptions are thrown.

## Using

This is probably best demonstrated with some code:

```java
// We could use any driver for our tests...
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();

// ... but only if it supports javascript
capabilities.setJavascriptEnabled(true);

// Get a handle to the driver. This will throw an exception
// if a matching driver cannot be located
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(capabilities);

// Query the driver to find out more information
Capabilities actualCapabilities = ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getCapabilities();

// And now use it
driver.get("http://www.google.com");
```

One nice feature of the remote webdriver is that exceptions often have an attached screen shot, encoded as a Base64 PNG. In order to get this screenshot, you need to write code similar to:

```java
public String extractScreenShot(WebDriverException e) {
  Throwable cause = e.getCause();
  if (cause instanceof ScreenshotException) {
    return ((ScreenshotException) cause).getBase64EncodedScreenshot();
  }
  return null;
}
```

## `RemoteWebDriver` Modes

The remote webdriver comes in two flavours:

  * **Client mode**: where the language bindings connect to the remote instance. This is the way that the `FirefoxDriver`, `OperaDriver`, and the `RemoteWebDriver` client normally work.
  * **Server mode**: where the language bindings are responsible for setting up the server, which the driver running in the browser can connect to. The `ChromeDriver` works in this way.

We realise that these terms are confusing, so please feel free to suggest something better!
